# anammox-origin
Dated the origin time of anammox bacteria with latest genomical sequences from NCBI

Molecuar dating analysis of the origin time of anammox bacteria includes multiple parts and a raw workflow for dating a focal lineage with all published genomes.
It includes but not only
1. download all genomes available (not limited at NCBI)
2. build species tree with markers genes and gene trees and following reconciliation
3. annotation with multiple databases for following comparative analysis
4. molecular dating analysis based on MCMCTree impletement in PAML and *Bayes Factor calculation*


Above steps mostly are depend on the another toolkit ([evol-tk](https://github.com/444thLiao/evol_tk)) 
If you want to utilize scripts involved in above steps, maybe you should import functions or run some scripts from this repo.
